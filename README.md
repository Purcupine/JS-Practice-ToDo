# JS-Practice-ToDo

A very basic project consisting of one image, HTML, CSS and JS files made with little help of jQuery and localStorage API.

Fill up the form and submit the values to create to-do tabs in your to-do list.
The tabs are going to be remembered even if you close your browser thanks to localStorage API.
